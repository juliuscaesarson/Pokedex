Pokedex with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS

This project is basically an encyclopedia of all the cute little monsters from the Pokemon universe. 

It first displays every Pokemon in a list with each list item being color coded by its respective Pokemon's type(s). 

Because this list consists of 807 individual little creatures, you can easily search for a Pokemon by name, id, or type(s) 
in the search bar, which automatically refreshes the list to show Pokemon(s) you may be looking for. 

When you click on a Pokemon, it will open up a new page that provides more detailed information about the selected Pokemon, 
such as height, weight, and base stats. 

If you want to feel like you are in the TV show, you can then click on the big blue button on the top left corner 
to initiate a text-to-speech function that reads out the selected Pokemon's description in a computer voice.
